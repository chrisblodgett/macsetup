## 🍺 Install Homebrew and XCode command line tools.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the macOS package manager I use to install and manage software from the command line. It simplifies the setup of essential tools and applications. Below will also install Xcode command line Tools.

### 🔧 Installation

Run the following command in Terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

## 🧭 Install Microsoft Edge Browser

Microsoft Edge is my preferred browser for its performance, privacy features, and Chromium-based developer tools.

### 🔧 Installation (via Homebrew)
